# SoC_Project
## The Image Cartoonifier
This repository documents the progress and learnings from the SoC project. 
It contains the Jupyter notebook assignments.
The initial weeks' resourses contain Python documentations and material for machine learning algorithms like linear regression, classification and logistic regression.
The next few weeks' span the contents like deep learning, improving deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks.
This material serves a solid foundation for understanding the implementation side of the project.
At last there's a paper titled "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style", which has to be implemented as this the core objective of this project.
