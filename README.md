# SoC_Project
## The Image Cartoonifier
This repository documents the progress and learnings from the SoC project. 
It contains the Jupyter notebook assignments.
From Week 1 resources, I have learned about Python and its applications.
From Week 2 resources, I have learned about Linear regression, Classification and Logistic regression.
In the current week, I'll be learning about deep learning and convolutional neural networks.
